# react-covid19-tracker

# Basic Plan:

1 Get covid 19 data from the NYT API <br />
2 Process the data <br />
- Might need to have an express server to do this API calls and process the data
- Probably do not want to do this all on the front end. <br />
3 Once the data is retrived from the API plot the data using a chart library. 
- For now we will use Chart.js 


# Resources

Going to build with node.js



# TODOS
Refactor the server side code --> more specifically splitting the numbers and dates array <br />
Refactor the state in the form component looks pretty sloppy<br />
Refactor the component too, might need to remane the form component and let it just be the main component. Or try to split the form into its own component. <br />
Fix the styling of the stats display component. <br />
