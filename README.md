# react-covid19-tracker

# Basic Plan:

1 Get covid 19 data from the NYT API <br />
2 Process the data <br />
- Might need to have an express server to do this API calls and process the data
- Probably do not want to do this all on the front end. <br />
3 Once the data is retrived from the API plot the data using a chart library. 
- For now we will use Chart.js 


# Resources 
API: https://corona.lmao.ninja/docs/#/COVID-19%3A%20NYT

CHART: https://www.chartjs.org/

Going to build with node.js



# TODOS
Create-react-app <br />
Bring in bootstrap for styling <br />
Make the api calls work <br />
